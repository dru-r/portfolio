# Understanding characters via dialogue and actions - WIP
This is currently a WIP; the write-up will be done after completion.<br>
<br>
My main motivation for this analysis is to augment understanding of the characterisation of certain characters in fandom, [from the work on tags I've done](https://dru-r.github.io/portfolio/p1/tag-usage.html). The actual fanfic text is likely to be a trove of how the author(s) view the characters, via the words they write them speaking and the actions they think the characters should perform. As with the previous analysis, I believe that the idea behind this analysis is applicable beyond fanfiction. For example, we tell narratives about real people all the time too - we quote them, and certain descriptions of the way they act and who they acted in a way to insinuate to some degree the way we see them as well.<br>
<br>
Currently, [I've worked on some dialogue analysis with one character from the Detroit: Become Human fandom (Connor, RK800)](https://dru-r.github.io/ao3-dbh-analysis/dbh-condialogue-1.html). The preprocessing of the long fic text, coreference resolution, etc. was handled by [BookNLP](https://github.com/booknlp/booknlp). However, I found that - likely due to the non-standard formatting/writing that many fanfics follow - many dialogue snippets were misattributed or not pulled out in full.<br>
<br>
I am working on cleaning that up and am also currently working on the extraction of actions done by characters in the fics.
