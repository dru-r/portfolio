## side-project summaries

### Main side-project: Analysis of fanfiction from archiveofourown.org (AO3)
<b>Background</b>: I've worked plenty with social media data. Online communities congregate around other mediums too, however. Fanfiction is one such medium, with a long history acting as one of the pillars for many fandoms. Reader/viewer perceptions of characters are described and shaped via these narratives, some ideas catch a spark and spread and grow into full-fledged tropes.<br><br>
Having been a contributer to various fandoms - in fanfiction and fanart - for many years, fandom in its form of fanfiction was the side-project I dreamt of doing when I first learned to work with code. It started as a way to practise the simplest Python, then basic analyses, and has now become a dataset that I revisit again and again whenever I want to try a method I've just read about.<br><br>
<b>Dataset</b>: This is a self-scraped dataset of 16,211 Detroit: Become Human (D:BH) AO3 fanfiction stories with public metadata and their 486,907 comments. This dataset is a complete snapshot of all the D:BH fanfiction available on AO3 in June 2020 (when the scrape was done).<br>
I also make reference to analyses done on the [data dump provided by AO3 in March 2021](https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/18804).<br>
