Hello and welcome to my always-WIP portfolio.<br><br>

I've created this space to highlight and further reflect on applications of certain analyses I've done on my main side-project outside of work. The data from the side-project is not the only data source I'm able to work with, and so I hope to eventually expand my side-project collection, if time allows. Visit [side-project summaries](https://dru-r.github.io/portfolio/summary.html) to find out more. <br><br>

I talk more about myself in [about me](https://dru-r.github.io/portfolio/about.html).
