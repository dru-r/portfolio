## about me
I'm interested in online communities, especially the analysis and understanding of narratives as created and recreated by them. I'm specifically interested in working to achieve this via appropriate applications of text analysis, network analysis, and statistical techniques.<br><br>

My formal background is in psychology research. I started my journey in undergraduate with survey research and SPSS. I then self-learned Python and R, allowing myself to expand into the area of computational social science for my masters research. Today, my current day-job is in the information space.<br><br>

I'm always looking for opportunities to work with online data for good.<br><br>

My current side-project examines the online writings of a fandom. If you [drop by to give it a look](https://dru-r.github.io/portfolio/summary.html) , I hope you enjoy the read as much as I enjoyed creating those analyses.<br><br>

Outside of this, I enjoy drawing and writing. I'm a long-time MMO fan and am currently on FF14. I also enjoy the occasional roguelite and RPG. I speak English and some Russian.
